<p>The Promo API enables partners to create promotions in the Expedia marketplace. It complements the existing Expedia Partner Central (EPC) self-service promo tools and thus provides more flexibility and options for hoteliers to manage their offering on the Expedia marketplace.</p>
<h2 id="authentication" data-magellan-destination="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>Partner must include a valid username/password in the HTTP header of the request using the below format: </p>
<pre><code>Authorization: Basic {username and password encoded by Base64}
</code></pre><p>Example: </p>
<pre><code>Authorization: Basic RVFDVXNlcjplUWNQYSQkd29yRA==
</code></pre><p>Where &quot;RVFDVXNlcjplUWNQYSQkd29yRA==&quot; is the string &quot;EQCtest12933873:cc47an46&quot; (username:password) Base64-encoded.</p>

<h2 id="promo-create-operation" data-magellan-destination="promo-create-operation">Promo Create Operation</h2>
<p>The Promo Create Operation supports two types of promotions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Promotion with percent (%) discount: applicable to any type of hotel/product.</li>
<li>Promotion with amount ($) discount: only applicable to HotelCollect-only properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each create request is for a single promotion. The API performs duplicate check based on all fields in the request. In other words if the same request is sent twice by the partner, the second request is considered a duplicate.</p>
<p>In case of a duplicate, the service returns an HTTP 409 (Conflict error) indicating a duplicate promotion already exists and the duplicate request is ignored. The service returns error code 3729 or 3730 in the response payload for duplicate request error. </p>
<h3 id="request" data-magellan-destination="request">Request</h3>
<p>The request is sent to the below endpoint:
<a href="https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/promotions/v1/hotels/{hotelid}/promos">https://services.expediapartnercentral.com/promotions/v1/hotels/{hotelid}/promos</a></p>

<p>After the request is processed by the Promo API, a response is returned back synchronously to the partner. The response will contain an HTTP status code in the header and a response payload.</p>
<p>In case of a success, the service generates a unique identifier for the newly created promotion, which is returned in the response payload along with all other promotion parameters from the original request. The promotion status is set to Active by default. </p>
<p>A promo score maybe returned in the response for the promotion with percent (%) discount.

<p>The service will perform the same validations on the preview request including duplicate check. But when the “preview” field is set to true, the service will return the promo score without creating the promotion. </p>
<p>The range of the score returned by the service is between 0.0 and 10.0. The score represents how your promotion may perform based on our analysis of key attributes like discount level, booking window and length of stay restriction. A higher score means better promotion strength.</p>
